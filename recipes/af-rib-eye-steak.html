    <h5>Amazing rib eye steak made in an air fryer... you won't tell the difference!</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 rib-eye steaks, cut 1 1/2- inch thick </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning®) </li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine steaks, soy sauce, olive oil, and seasoning in a large resealable bag. Marinate meat for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove steaks from bag and discard the marinade. Pat excess oil off the steaks.</li>
        <li>Add about 1 tablespoon water to the bottom of the air fryer pan to prevent it from smoking during the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Add steaks to air fryer and cook for 7 minutes. Turn steaks and cook for another 7 minutes until steak is medium rare. For a medium steak, increase the total cook time to 16 minutes, flipping steak after 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove steaks, keep warm, and let sit for about 4 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
